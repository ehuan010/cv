        Get Out of Your Head and into Your Life</a>
      by Gary John Bishop</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "I am willing" or "I am unwilling"
        <ul>
          <li>What are you willing to do to achieve your dreams. What are you
            unwiling to keep doing to stay where you are.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        "I Am Wired to Win"
        <ul>
          <li>You are winning at the life you want right now. Once you accept and
            think about what life you really want you can start to win in new ways.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        "I Got This"
        <ul>
          <li>You have lived until now and you got through even the hardest of
            times. Nothing will stop you from moving forward and living the life
            that you want</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        "I Embrace the Uncertainty"
        <ul>
          <li>"Remember, all of the successes, all of the experiences, all of the things
          you've always dramed of are waiting for you in uncertainty. Once you accept this,
          it's not as scary as before."</li>

      <li>
        "I Am Not My Thoughts; I Am What I Do"
        <ul>
          <li>"It's all about action. Going out there, doing it, and taking all your negative
          bs along for the ride. It's never going to get any better, any easier, or any more
          understandable. This is it, life is now and you're never going to have a better moment
          than this."</li>
